What are these icons used for?

These icons are crucial for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and other web
 applications that can be "installed" on a user's device. When a user
  adds your web app to their home screen or app launcher, the browser
   uses these defined icons to represent your application. 
   Providing multiple sizes ensures that the icon looks crisp and 
   clear on various devices and screen densities.
